# surf-emailing-automator
For this project I want to write a script that will scrape surfing websites and look for relevant data that indicates if a
particular surfing location has good days coming up in the forecast. And if they do, I want it to email me. 

I plan on using a cron job to run this script regularly to check regularly. Ideally, this will only email you once
for a particular location for a specific day. This is so you don't get spammed by emails saying the surf is good for the same location on the same 
day, however frequently the cron job is running. 

The purpose of this project is to help me learn about: 
* cron jobs
* bash
* webscraping
